# CSC207-Project-Description
This is a repository for our CSC207 project. For this project we would like to work on a project domain based on an 
inventory management system for an electronics company. 

In developing this application, we would love to add features that include product descriptions such as the costs,
seller information and any other detail/ features related to the product we have in our inventory (what it does, 
how much is available for us to buy). We also plan to introduce an ordering function where, based on our current level 
of inventory, we can recommend items which need to be restocked. Going on a more complex route on our ordering, we can 
implement a cost-price algorithm which recommends a product to buy more of based on the analyses the trends of sales of 
a product (the amount sold and at what price), comparing it to the current seller's price and whether there is 
great profit to be gained. Some more basic uses of our inventory management system would be to use it to measure and 
record the amount of transactions (helps with audit trailing), calculating profits and losses, and lastly, forecasting 
(predicting the future inventory needs),
